        <h2 id="skillTitle">Skills</h2>
        <p>
            <blockquote><sup>1</sup>There is a skill that I recently don't use which is my skill to sing. 
                <sup>2</sup>Though many people may think of it as a talent, I see it as a skill because I've learned that singing can be improved through practicing. 
                <sup>3</sup>Though I know that it can be considered a talent as well since there are people who are already good at singing when they are still children, they still need to practice it until they become good enough to perform. 
                <sup>4</sup>In my point of view, I started singing as long as I can remember, and I wanted to learn to sing because all of my siblings could sing. 
                <sup>5</sup>My first music teacher was my brother, who is four years older than me, and as far as I know, the first song that I sang was "Love Story" by Taylor Swift. 
                <sup>6</sup>Singing wasn't the only skill I got early since I learned swimming too when I was a child. 
                <sup>7</sup>I clearly remember learning to swim when I was five years old during a family vacation in Batangas. 
                <sup>8</sup>My father wanted to teach me how to swim quickly and he decided that the best approach was to throw me into the sea. 
                <sup>9</sup>That moment was pure terror since it was super sudden and the feeling of being eaten by the sea, and the panic of not knowing how to stay afloat were overwhelming. 
                <sup>10</sup>I coughed out water that time and flailing my arms and legs instinctively, trying to find the ground that wasn't there. 
                <sup>11</sup>But after the fear that i felt something clicked. 
                <sup>12</sup>Driven by my instinct to survive, I started to move my limbs in a way that propelled me forward, however awkwardly. 
                <sup>13</sup>Slowly, I began to understand the rhythm of the water, the way my body could interact with it, and the feeling of actually moving, instead of just sinking. 
                <sup>14</sup>What started as a scary experience was transformed into something super amazing. 
                <sup>15</sup>The fear didn't completely disappear, but it was replaced by a sense of accomplishment and confidence in the water. 
                <sup>16</sup>I remember laughing and splashing, no longer afraid of swimming, but instead enjoying its waves and the feeling that I am indeed swimming. 
                <sup>17</sup>That day in Batangas, I not only learned how to swim, but I also learned a valuable lesson about overcoming fear and discovering hidden strengths within myself. 
                <sup>18</sup>It was a scary, fun, and ultimately unforgettable experience, one that made me love the sea that I still carry to this day. 
                <sup>19</sup>It also taught me the importance of perseverance, as I had to keep trying despite my initial panic. 
                <sup>20</sup>The feeling of getting over that fear and mastering a new skill was incredibly amazing. 
                <sup>21</sup>Looking back, I realize that my father's bad yet effective teaching method, though initially frightening, was effective in its own way. 
                <sup>22</sup>It forced me to confront my fear head-on and discover my own resilience. 
                <sup>23</sup>And while I wouldn't necessarily recommend throwing a five-year-old into the ocean, I am grateful for the experience that taught me how to swim.

        <p>
            <blockquote></blockquote><sup>1</sup>I started playing the guitar in the 7th grade of my high school years, it has become one of my most enjoyable hobbies. 
    <sup>2</sup>My brother, who was six years older than me, carefully helped me in knowing the basic chords and strumming patterns. 
    <sup>3</sup>Through the strings of an old and rusty acoustic guitar that my father bought 5 years ago at that time. 
    <sup>4</sup>That acoustic guitar that our father bought opened my eyes to a whole new world of music.
    <sup>5</sup>I remember my brother singing something that time and I was so amazed by just watching him. 
    <sup>6</sup>I then asked him if he can teach me how to play it and I recall feeling both excited and terrified since my brother let me borrow the guitar and teach me some songs. 
    <sup>7</sup>My brother was the ideal teacher because of his calm attitude. 
    <sup>8</sup>He began by teaching me basics, including how to hold the pick, place my fingers on the fretboard, and strum easy chords. 
    <sup>9</sup>He emphasized the importance of rhythm and timing, patiently correcting my mistakes and encouraging me to keep practicing. 
    <sup>10</sup>He showed me my errors and advised me to continue practicing, pointing out the importance of timing and rhythm. 
    <sup>11</sup>The Eraserheads' "Ang Huling El Bimbo" was the first song he taught me and the one that started my passion for playing. 
    <sup>12</sup>I was determined to learn it perfectly because of its attracting tune and relatable lyrics. 
    <sup>13</sup>The chords were practiced for hours, moving between them slowly yet persistently. 
    <sup>14</sup>Even though my wrist and hands are tired and my fingers hurt, it was so satisfying to play a few bars accurately at last. 
    <sup>15</sup>My brother would frequently join in, harmonizing with me and giving me pointers on how to get better at it.
    <sup>16</sup>I was able to learn an entire new set of music when he taught me how to read tablature. 
    <sup>17</sup>Our house would be filled with music as we jammed together in the evenings, me on my acoustic and him on his electric guitar. 
    <sup>18</sup>It wasn't always simple to learn the guitar because at times, I wanted to give up because I was so upset. 
    <sup>19</sup>But I continued because of my brother's constant encouragement and my own developing interest. 
    <sup>20</sup>In the summer after my eighth-grade year, I had saved up 5,000 pesos when I asked my father to buy me an electric guitar. 
    <sup>21</sup>After my father gave his approval, we traveled all the way to Sta. I think we rode three jeepneys just to get to Mesa, Manila. 
    <sup>22</sup>As we explored the guitars in each store, I was instantly drawn to a Les Paul-style instrument. 
    <sup>23</sup>It wasn't as popular as other models, and it was just the style I desired. 
    <sup>24</sup>We paid 8,000 pesos for it, which came with a speaker and amplifier. 
    <sup>25</sup>I couldn't wait to play my new electric guitar when I got home.
    <sup>26</sup>I've played that guitar for countless solos and songs. 
    <sup>27</sup>My parents wouldn't let me join a band, but I did consider it. 
    <sup>28</sup>Still, continuing to play as a hobby is enjoyable. 
    <sup>29</sup>Even today, I still sometimes pick it up and hang it on my wall. 
    <sup>30</sup>I started with basic chords and worked my way up to more difficult fingerpicking patterns. 
    <sup>31</sup>I even tried making my own songs. 
    <sup>32</sup>Playing the guitar evolved from a hobby to an instrument of expressing myself, a way of relaxing and relieve stress, and a connection to my brother and our similar appreciation of music. 
    <sup>33</sup>It's a talent that I keep developing and treasure, and it brings me satisfaction and joy every day. 
    <sup>34</sup>I now use the guitar as a voice and an extension of who I am, allowing me to connect with people and express my feelings. 
    <sup>35</sup>This journey, which started with "Ang Huling El Bimbo" and is still going strong today, is full of countless songs, special moments, and the timeless power of music.

            <blockquote></blockquote><sup>1</sup>I'm currently incredibly interested in many different subjects.  
        <sup>2</sup>Let's start with my course which is IT.  
        <sup>3</sup>It's actually something I'm studying in college, which is really awesome.  
        <sup>4</sup>Particularly with AI and machine learning, the speed at which technology is evolving is kind of insane.  
        <sup>5</sup>Thinking about what is ahead is both really exciting and a little scary. 
        <sup>6</sup>After graduation, I'm not really sure what I want to do, but I'm considering a career in web development or user-centered design. 
        <sup>7</sup>The concept of creating useful things attracts me.  
        <sup>8</sup>Then there are cars.  
        <sup>9</sup>Since playing racing games on my iPad as a young child, I have been completely obsessed with them.
        <sup>10</sup>Please don't judge me!  
        <sup>11</sup>But really, I like all of them, including their appearance, sound, and performance.  
        <sup>12</sup>I'm beginning to study mechanics, which is much more difficult than I initially anticipated.  
        <sup>13</sup>One day, I hope to acquire a classic vehicle and do the necessary repairs.  Lastly, there are motorcycles.  
        <sup>14</sup>They're simply amazing.  
        <sup>15</sup>Although I haven't received my license yet, I intend to do so as soon as possible.  
        <sup>16</sup>The desire is to simply ride a motorcycle down an open road while enjoying the sun and wind.
        <sup>17</sup>After I graduate from college, I want to take some long road trips.  
        <sup>18</sup>That's exactly what I'm interested in at the moment which are motorcycles, cars, and IT.  
        <sup>19</sup>Despite their significant differences, I guess they all share something in common.  
        <sup>20</sup>They're all about solving problems, being creative, and simply experiencing things.  
        <sup>21</sup>These are the topics that truly catch my attention, and I'm constantly searching for new things to discover and learn.  
        <sup>22</sup>I spend the majority of my time thinking about them and am passionate about them.  
        <sup>23</sup>Maybe it's a strange combination, but it's me.
