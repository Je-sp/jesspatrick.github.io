        <h2 id="childhoodTitle">Childhood Years</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> My childhood memories are quite blurry, but I have pictures that remind me of the many places I visited with my family. 
            <sup>2</sup> My parents always tell me stories about how we traveled between provinces almost every year. 
            <sup>3</sup> We frequently rode the RORO (passenger boat) from Batangas to Mindoro, my mother’s hometown. 
            <sup>4</sup> On other occasions, we traveled to La Union, where my father’s hometown is located. 
            <sup>5</sup> My sister, who was working abroad, once surprised us with a trip to Palawan. 
            <sup>6</sup> It was my first time riding an airplane, and I remember feeling both nervous and excited. 
            <sup>7</sup> This happened when I was in fourth grade, making it one of my most unforgettable experiences. 
            <sup>8</sup> Another significant moment in my childhood happened in fifth grade when I joined the Boy Scouts. 
            <sup>9</sup> I was given the honor of carrying the Makati City flag during a school event. 
            <sup>10</sup> By sixth grade, my responsibility grew, and I became the official flag bearer of the Philippine national flag in my school. 
            <sup>11</sup> Throughout various school events, I proudly held the national flag, representing my school, Pembo Elementary School. 
            <sup>12</sup> It felt like an achievement because not everyone was given that role. 
            <sup>13</sup> My elementary school years were filled with excitement and learning. 
            <sup>14</sup> I made many friends and discovered my love for participating in school activities. 
            <sup>15</sup> Despite not remembering everything, the stories and pictures help me reconnect with my childhood. 
            <sup>16</sup> Looking back, I realize how much my early years shaped the person I am today. 
            <sup>17</sup> They taught me the value of travel, family bonding, and leadership. 
            <sup>18</sup> I may not remember every small detail, but the moments I do recall are special. 
            <sup>19</sup> Those experiences helped me become more responsible, confident, and eager to explore the world. 
            <sup>20</sup> Childhood was a phase of joy and innocence, where every new experience brought excitement.

    <section id="teenage">
        <h2 id="teenageTitle">Teenage Years</h2>

        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> My teenage years were full of new experiences that shaped who I became. 
            <sup>2</sup> From my 7<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade, I started to explore more about myself and the world around me. 
            <sup>3</sup> It was during high school that I experienced many “firsts.” 
            <sup>4</sup> The first time I had a girlfriend, the first time I learned to play guitar, and the first time I joined a field trip. 
            <sup>5</sup> These were all moments that I will never forget. 
            <sup>6</sup> High school also introduced me to new friendships that I still hold dear today. 
            <sup>7</sup> It was a time where I learned to balance schoolwork with personal interests. 
            <sup>8</sup> I also had my first taste of freedom, where I could hang out with my friends and enjoy new activities. 
            <sup>9</sup> In 11th grade, I attended a school field trip that was free for us, and I made the most of it. 
            <sup>10</sup> I was also introduced to new hobbies, such as playing music and cycling. 
            <sup>11</sup> During the pandemic, cycling became a way for me to cope, and I even rode all the way to Antipolo and Tagaytay. 
            <sup>12</sup> Those long rides, especially the Laguna loop with my friends, gave me a sense of independence and accomplishment. 
            <sup>13</sup> I remember the time I got drunk for the first time, which, although a learning experience, became one of those stories we all laugh about now. 
            <sup>14</sup> The pandemic made me reflect on the important things in life, and I became more aware of the people who truly matter. 
            <sup>15</sup> I also became more responsible, as high school is where I started to understand the importance of balancing work and play. 
            <sup>16</sup> As a teenager, I faced challenges that made me stronger and more determined to chase my dreams. 
            <sup>17</sup> It was during this time that I began thinking about my future more seriously. 
            <sup>18</sup> The teenage years were filled with ups and downs, but they prepared me for the journey ahead. 
            <sup>19</sup> I grew more confident in who I was and learned to navigate the complexities of life. 
            <sup>20</sup> High school gave me the foundation I needed to face the adult world.

    <section id="college">
        <h2 id="collegeTitle">College Years</h2>

        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> Now in my second year of college, studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, I look back and realize that choosing this path was not as straightforward as I once thought. 
            <sup>2</sup> In fact, IT wasn’t my first choice; I had initially wanted to pursue a degree in Civil Engineering. 
            <sup>3</sup> However, due to not being accepted into the state universities I applied to, I had to rethink my options. 
            <sup>4</sup> It was a struggle to decide what to do, especially considering the financial challenges of attending a private university. 
            <sup>5</sup> At one point, I even considered not going to college at all, but my sister stepped in and helped me. 
            <sup>6</sup> She promised to pay half of my tuition fees for each school year, making it possible for me to continue my education. 
            <sup>7</sup> My sister also encouraged me to apply for IT, even though I originally wanted to study Computer Science. 
            <sup>8</sup> I trusted her advice and followed her suggestion. 
            <sup>9</sup> When it came to choosing my school, I opted for one far from home, as my sister had recommended it. 
            <sup>10</sup> Looking back, I’m glad I made that choice, as it has provided me with a unique experience. 
            <sup>11</sup> College has been a mix of excitement and anxiety for me, as everything is new. 
            <sup>12</sup> As a slow learner, I sometimes find it frustrating when I can’t grasp things as quickly as I would like. 
            <sup>13</sup> I constantly remind myself to pay attention in class, take notes, and stay focused to improve my learning. 
            <sup>14</sup> This is my first time attending a private school, and the experience has been quite different from my previous years in public schools. 
            <sup>15</sup> I also had my first experience of commuting by train to school, which has become a part of my daily routine. 
            <sup>16</sup> Another first was attending a basketball game as part of my Physical Education subject. 
            <sup>17</sup> Although at first I felt uneasy, it turned out to be a fun and exciting experience. 
            <sup>18</sup> In college, I’ve faced many challenges, but I’ve also had moments of growth and joy. 
            <sup>19</sup> I’m starting to learn to embrace the ups and downs and adjust to this new chapter of my life. 
            <sup>20</sup> I’m excited about what the future holds, and I know that I’ll continue to evolve and learn.
